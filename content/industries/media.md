## Media & Retail Case Study

## The Problem
A leading social, digital television, shopping channel required a means to integrate a server farm of front-end applications with a cluster databases whilst managing enterprise requirements for resilience and redundancy. The client required integration between their website and database, registering all customers data.

## Our Solution
Ricston provided solution through the use of Mule ESB. To help manage the load and work with existing business practices, Ricston created traditional XML batch requests in Mule ESB. These validated and managed requests helped drive the legacy databases operation. Ricston not only provided a non-disruptive solution but the testing and performance implementations demonstrated a considerable boost in capacity without the need to additional expensive database nodes.
