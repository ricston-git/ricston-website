## European Government Agency Case Study

## The Problem
Providing a framework to support secure, managed web interfaces for enterprise applications deployed by a European Government Agency.

## Our Solution
To provide the European Government Agency with a in a secure, managed framework within which REST and SOAP internal Web-services could be made available to external partners Ricston were engaged to build and deploy a solution built on  Mule ESB Enterprise Edition (EE).

Ricston leveraged existing highly scalable LDAP services to provide Authentication, used Mule ESB EE out-of-the-box caching services to boost performance and protect key systems from excessive load.

Ricston were able to provide best practice implementations of HTTP and the CXF transports as well as key testing and performance monitoring that ensured high availability and throughput for services made available to all European Agencies partners.
