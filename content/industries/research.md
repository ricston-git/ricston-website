## Research and Analysis Organisation Case Study

## The Problem
A leading research and analysis organisation based required complex decision routing to process incoming data and enable management of their back-end systems. They needed to achieve this while maintaining and extending their existing investment in their website and Siebel CRM system.

## Our Solution
The client's design was specified to build a solution using jBPM (JBoss’ Business Processing Management) flows, to provide business control to complex business rules regarding website management and content routing.  Using Mule ESB’s integrated BPM module, Ricston consultants were able to provide this integration. They were also able to integrate the platform into enterprise level queuing (JMS) to guarantee message delivery. Mule’s out of the box database connectors were also used to provide data management and integration into existing legacy databases. 

When the client became aware that Ricston could also integrate their legacy Siebel CRM with their new website platforms. Ricston consultants were again able to use Mule connectors to connect new users registration on the client's website are inserted directly into the existing CRM.
